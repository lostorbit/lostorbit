I put together this website in an effort to have a central place to keep track
of some of the projects I spend most of my time on, and to keep an updated 
resume on the web. I needed a quick-and-dirty
way to update everything, and it needed to be reliable and secure. It needed to 
be crazy-simple to customize, and overall look professional. I really didn't
want to use a pre-existing CMS like Drupal, and I didn't want to shoehorn
Wordpress into something it shouldn't be.
I also wanted to brush up on my PHP, as it's been far too long since I've needed
to do a "real" project with it. Overall, it had to be simple to make, simple
to maintain, and simple to update.

Thus, this website (in its present form) was born!

I'm using three-ish PHP files to pull [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
formatted text files, and assemble some HTML. It's stupid-easy. Every now and
then I'll run a script on my own to make sure tag links are up to date.

As for the site theme, I'm using pictures of [Dione](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=4457)
and [Enceladus](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=4458)
from the [Cassini mission](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/) for background images,
and tried to be as minimalistic as possible for everything else. It's partially
inspired by another engineer's personal site I'd come across awhile ago, but
I've since lost the link.
