Summer 2011 CubeSat Developer's Workshop^^^
I had the chance to present at this past summer's [CubeSat Developer's Workshop](http://cubesat.org/index.php/workshops/past-workshops/2011summerslides)
in Logan, Utah, just around the time of the [SmallSat](http://smallsat.org)
conference. This is the first public apperance of COPPER's present iteration, as
both a two-mission and a 1U CubeSat. Watch for a quick overview!
