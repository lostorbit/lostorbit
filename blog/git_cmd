git - bare minimum^^^
The bare minimum commands you need to update your git repo and sync
to your github account are as follows:
~~~
git status
git add <any new files>
git commit -a -m "Update Description"
git push -u origin master
~~~
There, I said it. I didn't see this written down anywhere in this order. And now it is.
